# ForFun
Lua and Python random scripts here that I made during school, because I'm bored

The CheckList lua program is a program I made during my statistics class during 12/18/25. I had finished all my work and this was a day prior to the winter break so I just wanted to make something for fun.
    The checklist is similar to my real life journal. In my purple journal I will write a list of tasks that I want to acomplish everyday and I wanted to program it in lua for fun.
